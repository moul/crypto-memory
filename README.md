# crypto-memory
Cryptography key-pairs memory game (with traps)

## Concept

The goal of this script is to generate multiple keyparis (private + public keys), make transformations, and finally shuffle everything.

Then, the "game" is to find the related keys (`private key <-> public key` or `key in format X <-> the same key in format Y`).
